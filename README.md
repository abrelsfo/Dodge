# MeteorReboot2.0
Recreated a game I helped make in high school with a few extra features that weren't in the original.

Left and Right arrow keys to move.

White blocks = 2x score

Red blocks = faster fall speed

Blue blocks = lines from green block to all others

Purple blocks = Dodge at all costs

Uses python 2.7
