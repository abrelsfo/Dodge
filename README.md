# MeteorReboot2.0
Recreated a game I helped make in high school with a few extra features that weren't in the original.

**How To Play**<br>
Left and Right arrow keys to move.

Each block that you miss is one point

White blocks are 2x score multipliers that stack

Red blocks speed up the falling blocks

Blue blocks draw lines from your block to each falling block

Dodge the purple blocks.

Esc to quit

**Installation**<br>
Uses python 2.7 but should be compatible for python 3.3

This program needs openCV, lazyflow, and Numpy to run.

You can download OpenCV from this [link](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)<br>
Use pip -install numpy to install numpy<br>
The lazyflow module can be found on github [here](https://github.com/ilastik/lazyflow/blob/master/lazyflow/utility/fileLock.py)

Under the highscores function you will need to change the path directory to your own.<br>
Lastly create a highscores.txt file in the directory you chose
