# MeteorReboot2.0
Recreated a game I helped make in high school with a few extra features that weren't in the original.

Use the Left and Right arrow keys to move.

The white blocks are 2x score

The red blocks speed up the falling blocks

The blue blocks draw lines from from each falling block to your block

Dodge the purple blocks at all time.

press esc to quit

Uses python 2.7

This program needs openCV and Numpy to run. You can download OpenCV from this link: http://opencv.org/downloads.html

Numpy you can use pip -install numpy and that should be all you need.
