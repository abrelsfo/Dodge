# MeteorReboot2.0
Recreated a game I helped make in high school with a few extra features that weren't in the original.

**How To Play**<br>
-Left and Right arrow keys to move.<br>
-Each block that you miss is one point<br>
-White blocks are 2x score multipliers that stack<br>
-Red blocks speed up the falling blocks<br>
-Blue blocks draw lines from your block to each falling block<br>
-Dodge the purple blocks.<br>
-Esc to quit<br>

**Installation**<br>
Uses python 2.7 but should be compatible for python 3.3

This program needs openCV, lazyflow, and Numpy to run.

You can download OpenCV from this [link](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)<br>
Use pip -install numpy to install numpy<br>
The lazyflow module can be found on github [here](https://github.com/ilastik/lazyflow/blob/master/lazyflow/utility/fileLock.py)

Under the highscores function you will need to change the path directory to your own.<br>
Lastly create a highscores.txt file in the directory you chose
